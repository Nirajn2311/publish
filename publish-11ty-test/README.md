# Prototype for new CMS (Frontend: 11ty)

## How to run locally

You need to run the backend app in your local too.

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `yarn install`
3. In another terminal, start the backend Strapi app by `npm run develop`
4. Run `yarn serve` to build the static site and serve it
5. Visit http://localhost:8080/ to see the user-facing site

* If you made changes to the contents in the backend, you will need to re-build the frontend static site by running the `yarn serve` command again to see the changes.
